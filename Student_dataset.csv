TLC,Waterfalls,1994,soul,"A lonely mother gazing out of the window Staring at a son that she just can't touch If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much But all the praying just ain't helping at all 'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how Another body laying cold in the gutter Listen to me Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation But he just can't see She gives him loving that his body can't handle But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me"" One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror But he doesn't recognize his own face His health is fading, and he doesn't know why Three letters took him to his final resting place Y'all don't hear me Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (Your way or no way) But I think you're moving too fast Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast You might also like[Verse 3: Left Eye] Come on! I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew Clear blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein? What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain You claim the insane, and name this day in time For falling prey to crime I say the system's got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast) Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go) Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (I know, I know, your way hey) But I think you're moving too fast"

We wanna dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives? ""Black Lives Matter, to use an analogy, is like if... if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire. The fire department wouldn't show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter. They would show up and they would turn their water on the house that was burning because that's the house that needs the help the most. — My generation's taken on the torch of a very age-old fight for black liberation, but also liberation for everyone. Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere. — The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members. — I think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is, 'What are you willing to risk? What are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society?'""
